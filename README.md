## Netflix clone mainly using NEXT JS, TYPESCRIPT, STYLED COMPONENTS, SERVER SIDE RENDERING and REDUX.

This netflix clone was created in NEXT JS, using FIREBASE to perform the login function, STYLED COMPONENTS to style the project, and THE MOVIE DATABASE API to consume movie poster images. 

-This clone has: 

- HOMEPAGE: Here we have the classic netflix homepage, where we have a movie trailer, which when it ends shows a wallpaper of the movie, we also have a function to repeat the trailer again and we also have a trailer mute function (trailer that changes every time we update the page and has its corresponding 'more info' section where we can see a modal with the information about the movie, the actors and recommended movies, just as it appears on netflix), then inside the homepage we have the sliders section, where we can see several movies of different categories, we also have a fictitious 'coming soon' section where we can appreciate a slider with several movie posters, this is not found on netflix but it was a good idea to consume data from an api to do server side rendering. finally we have a footer, all these features of the homepage have their corresponding responsive design so they adapt to different devices.
